Updated for the modern era, the Thoreau is a veritable fortress built to enhance a fleet&rsquo;s offensive capabilities with a combination of advanced fire-control systems, aggressive NHP deportment, and robust power reserves, all supporting a hull bristling with weapons. With the sheer amount of firepower at its disposal, it isn&rsquo;t unheard of for a single Thoreau to be assigned as a &ldquo;fleet of one&rdquo; to the defense of a polity under Union&rsquo;s umbrella. Some critics within ThirdComm argue that the ship should be retired as part of the ongoing reorganization of Union&rsquo;s navy, citing its prominent role in SecComm&rsquo;s frequent use of &ldquo;battleship diplomacy&rdquo;, but the Thoreau simply remains too useful to mothball entirely.</p>","lid":"mf_-IgMGmItttMdwtLzZynXC","license_level":7,"mechtype":["BALANCED"],"mounts":["Heavy","Superheavy","Main/Aux","Main/Aux"],"name":"GMS Thoreau","source":null,"stats":{"armor":0,"edef":0,"evasion":12,"heatcap":5,"hp":25,"repcap":0,"save":0,"sensor_range":10,"size":4,"sp":0,"speed":5,"stress":4,"structure":4,"tech_attack":0},"traits":[{"name":"Barrage Doctrine","description":"<p>When you fire a <strong>PRIMARY</strong> weapon as part of <strong>All Ahead Full</strong>, you may use two <strong>Auxiliary</strong> weapon alongside it instead of just one.</p>","use":"?","actions":[],"bonuses":[],"synergies":[],"deployables":[],"integrated":[],"counters":[]}],"y_pos":30,"core_system":{"name":"Unleash Hell","description":"","use":"?","activation":"Quick","active_name":"Core Active","active_effect":"<h1><strong>Maneuver.
